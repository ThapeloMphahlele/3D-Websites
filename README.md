# 3D Website Project - README

## 🌟 Project Overview
Welcome to my first 3D website project! This is an experimental website featuring 3D elements and interactive components. I'm learning web-based 3D rendering as I build this project.

## � Features
- Basic 3D scene using Three.js
- Interactive 3D objects
- Simple animations
- Responsive design (work in progress)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Three.js
- HTML5/CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Open `index.html` in your browser

[If your project requires build steps, add them here]

## 📝 Notes for Beginners
As this is my first 3D web project:
- The code might not follow best practices yet
- Performance optimizations are still needed
- I'm open to suggestions and contributions!

## 🤝 Contributing
While this is a personal learning project, I welcome:
- Bug reports
- Suggestions for improvement
- Links to helpful learning resources
